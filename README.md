# Java| Selenium WebDriver | TestNG

# Current issues / workarounds:
Needs adblock .crx file(Chrome) or .xpi(Firefox) in order to work. 
Otherwise the constantly changing ad-popups will cause some of the tests to not complete. 

# Future improvements:
Incorporate Jenkins to allow testing on different platforms or Operating Systems.
Research more about preloading adblock before executing the tests or find a different way to block the ads.
